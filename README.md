# Python chess from sratch

- start on google colab for beginner kind of quick development (don't laugh at newbie)
- learn to build a chess game from scratch and an engine complicated enough to beat me
- use chess.JS / chessboard.JS for the front end and upload to heroku for example
    - show moves made
    - allow takeback
    - allow new game

## Future plan
- a bot on lichess, etc.
- improve on the engine
