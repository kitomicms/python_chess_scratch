# Python chess from sratch

- used jupyter notebook for quick development (don't laugh at newbie)
- learn to build a chess game from scratch and an engine complicated enough to beat me
- use chess.JS / chessboard.JS for the front end and upload to heroku for example
    - show moves made
    - allow takeback
    - allow new game

## Under development
- game feature outstanding:
    - castling
    - en passant
    - checkmate checked?
    - stalement
    - promotion
- engine
    - minimax prune

## Future plan
- a bot on lichess, etc.
- improve on the engine
